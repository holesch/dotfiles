Copyright (C) 2011-2012 Arto Jonsson <artoj@iki.fi>

ABOUT

    qmake is a Makefile generator used by the Qt toolkit.

    The 'qmake.vim' file provides syntax coloring for qmake project files.

INSTALLATION

    Put the 'syntax/qmake.vim' file to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/ directory.
    Then you can use:

        :set syntax=qmake

    To use the syntax in the current buffer.

    To set the syntax automatically for certain file types, such as '.pro' in
    this case, put the 'ftdetect/pro.vim' in $VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/ directory.

    See ':help ftdetect' for more information.

    Alternatively you can use bundle manager such as Vundle or Pathogen.
